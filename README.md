# Google API ArcGIS Integration

This project makes use of the Google Maps API and leverages ArcGIS technology for analysis. This project works by making a series of Google API Nearby Location calls and converts the JSON response into a CSV file. Using the Forward Sorting Stations for the Greater Toronto Area, a list of Longitude and Latitude were passed into the Google API using ArcPy. Depending on the user input, one may choose to look for a specific category of places such as bubble tea restaurants, hospitals, or police stations.
